# APSP

Code to accompany my preprint "A fast algorithm for All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths suitable for neural networks"

- All the code is in the Jupyter Notebook `APSP_4.ipynb`

- The figures rely on data precomputed and saved in `data/`

- To recreate all data and figures from scratch:

	- Clear the folders `figs/` and `data/`

	- Run the Jupyter Notebook `APSP_4.ipynb`

	- Now `figs/` should contain the figures used in the article.
